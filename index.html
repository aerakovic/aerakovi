        <p>Oil spills at sea cause huge environmental damage and cost millions to clean up.
            The solution? Spill-o-Pill. The exclusive product designed to mitigate the costs and risks of
            oil spill cleanup. Spill-o-Pill is unique in that it soaks up subsurface oil, that’s usually
            missed by the competition. By using a nanostructured material, oil is absorbed and water is kept out,
            turning an environmental pollutant into a ready-to-burn fuel source.

                  <h1>The Problem - <span style="color:#38c6f4";>Oil Spills</span></h1>
<p>


    In 1991 the largest oil spill in history occurred in the Arabian gulf, which resulted in a 4 inch thick oil slick across 4 thousand square miles.
</p>
                  <p>
    In 2010 the second largest oil spill in history occurred in the Gulf of Mexico, where 200 million gallons of crude oil were pumped into the ocean.
</p>
                  <p>
    Oil Spills cause long lasting and detrimental effects to our food stocks, industries and the environment. These spills, along with every other major oil spill are still in the process of being cleaned.
</p>
                  <ul>
                      <h3>
    Currently, there are three commonly used oil recovery techniques:</h3>
<li>
    Booms - to encompass the spill
</li>
                      <li>
    Skimmers – to retrieve the surface oil contained within the boom
</li>
                      <li>
    Harsh Chemicals – to emulsify oil into droplets, which remain suspended in water, and end up on the floor of the ocean
</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
    The purpose for these chemicals is to prevent the oil from reaching the shorelines. But at what cost?</p>
                  <div class="text-center">
<h3 style="font-style: italic;">
    These chemicals mostly hide the problem, they don’t solve it!</h3></div>

                      <span style="color:#38c6f4;">Our solution to you</span> – is a macroporous particle with oleophilic properties that, when coated, can be temporarily sustained in an aqueous medium.

                      The core component:
                      porous and hydrophobic
                      allows for high volume retention of a hydrophobic material – or  crude oil

                      The hydrophillic component:
                      Allows the particle to exist beneath the surface of the water, until it dissolves and the process of oil absorption begins.

                  <h3>How our product is applied.</h3>
                  <div class="small-8 columns small-centered" id="bigpic"></div>
<p>First: It is released as-is into the ocean near a sub-surface layer of oil. Although the hydrophobic core is lighter than water, the hydrophilic particles are made from a relatively dense material, causing it to sink.
</p><p>
    Second: Since the hydrophilic particles are water-soluble, it will dissolve over time, giving our particle a variable buoyancy.
              </p><p>
    Third: Now the hydrophilic component has been dissolved completely, and the core begins to rise toward the surface.
              </p><p>
    Fourth: The core passes once more through the layer of oil. This time, the coating is gone and the core absorbs the oil nearby.
              </p><p>
    Finally: The core reaches the surface, where it can be collected with ease.</p>
